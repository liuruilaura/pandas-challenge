## Executive Summary

> Overall, there are 15 schools with a total enrollment of 39,170 students and a combined budget of $24,649K. The average math score across these schools is 70, with an 86% passing rate. In comparison, the average reading score is 84, with a 73% passing rate.

### Details of the Report
1. **Top Performing Schools**

An analysis of the top-performing schools reveals that the five highest-ranked are Griffin High, Cabrera High, Bailey High, Wright High, and Rodriguez High. These include three independent and two government schools. All have average math scores above 71 and reading scores above 70. Their passing rates for math, reading, and overall exceed 90%, 87%, and 79%, respectively.

## Conclusion

* Independent schools generally outperform government schools.

* Higher spending per student does not necessarily correlate with better academic performance, as assessed by scores and passing rates.

* Smaller schools tend to exhibit better academic performance, suggesting that students in these environments may receive more focused attention from instructors, leading to higher scores and passing rates.
